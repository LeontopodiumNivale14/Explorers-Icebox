Things I want to work on when I can:
-> Make the CurrentAmount dynamically update the values like how the POS works
  -> thought of this while at work/talking to Ucan, currently it only updates on start of plugin (due to it being refreshed then)
  -> If i want to update at all times, then I should make a function that calls all of them at once to refresh it
    -> could tie this to only doing so while it's in IS, 
  -> could also use this to update all of them at once if I dont want permanent updates per tick
  -> probably would be best to use the "update all" after every gathering node, would save on code
-> Actually start testing Pcalls
-> Get the general code working

-> (thought of this at work
