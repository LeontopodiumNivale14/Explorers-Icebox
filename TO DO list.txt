Things I want to work on when I can:
-> Actually start testing Pcalls
-> Change over the RouteLoopAmounts to be dynamic with how many items you are currently inputting (so for the groundxp loop, if I throw 20 sand in the workshop, then I want it to dynamically show how many loops it's expected to do
-> While it's a forethought, I wonder if I can check to see if you have certain tools, that way it knows what it can/can't sell...

-> got the dynamic updating of items working in the workshop menu, but the values for the config/workshop is wrong.
-> Also while it's a thought, the "shopsend" in every table needs to be removed from being a variable that's external to it, to just being a value per row. Just because if I try to have it dynamically update based on the information, then it's going to be hella work.
