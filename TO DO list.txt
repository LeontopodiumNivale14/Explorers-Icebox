// things I want to do post update (Thanks @Croizat for the actual ideas)


public static void ItemImGui(uint itemId)
{
  if (!GetRow<Item>(itemId) is { } row) return;
  ImGui.AlignTextToFramePadding();
  ImGui.Text($"{row.Name} (Have: {GetItemCount(itemId})");
  // the rest
}

// change all the itemImGui's to have this instead. 
// this would also require me to change the rest of the information into a dictionary too.. but that's fine. Code cleanup is best practice.
// So probably have the dictionary have 
// -> ItemID as Key
// -> General GetItemCount (Not sure if this is necessary but would just be good to have as reference
// -> Workshop amount/input to be pulled/referenced
