Things I want to work on when I can:
-> Actually start testing Pcalls
-> While it's a forethought, I wonder if I can check to see if you have certain tools, that way it knows what it can/can't sell...
-> Need to setup a path after you return to the base to go to the workshop (now that you can actually return permanently)
-> Setup selling the items

(ImGui things)
-> Need to have a radio/checkbox for which route you wanna do (Ground XP vs Flying/Best XP grind)
-> Once selected which one you will do, have that set a value for which table to pull
-> Whenever you get to the shop, calculate the items you're selling
-> leave the shop (not sure if I want to make this a function... probably? Can only imagine so. Be a minor pain but, save time long run)
-> Head to destination
-> Start farming
(future thought) -> Setup a menu where you can select between farm XP/Cowries, or gather every item. (That way I can setup 2 seperate functions on how they would operate... cause trying to intertwine them sounds like a bad idea)
                 -> Like... atleast could use the function of ShopSell -> Goto Area -> Farm x amount of times for both, but can't have a "farm" loop and then a "gatherall" loop in the same instance.
